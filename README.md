Some ppt and pilot figures to share within group

## Note
All figures are time series data, containing population and trait dynamics of hosts and parasitoids. 

## Focal species
Pi - Indian meal moth - the host
Vc - a parasitoid

## Treatment
28: Constant temperature of 28 degree. 
De2 & Det4: Determinstic increase temperature at a rate of 2 & 4 degree over 18 months. 
Sto2 & Sto4: Determinstic increase plus temperature flucuations
a & b: Two random seed of generating flucuating temperature time series i.e., two replicates
